### Continuous Integration  
- Merging smaller commits frequently, instead of waiting until a project is "done" and doing one big merge.  
- This means that features can be realeased quicker!  
- CI only works well when there are test that ensure that new commits didn't "break the build"  
- It's even possible to perform a deployment at the end of a CI build.
